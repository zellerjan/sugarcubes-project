## Version-Info:
draft = static approach without any transitions / animations <br>
v1 = was the first approach, more static with hardcoded divs and more control <br>
v2 = more dynamic, less code and the divs are being generated by javascript, less control but more rules ;) <br>
v3 = pretty much like v2 but with a different (flip) animation <br>
FINAL = Final Poster
